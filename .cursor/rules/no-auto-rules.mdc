alwaysApply: true
---

- Cursor must not create any new files in this backend project without explicit developer approval.
- This includes rule files, configuration files, helper files, documentation, or any other type of file.
- Auto-generation commands such as /Generate Cursor Rules, /Create File, or similar must not be used unless explicitly requested.
- All file creation must be manual, intentional, and reviewed by the developer.
- This backend is governed by strict architectural control. No file should be added without direct permission.
